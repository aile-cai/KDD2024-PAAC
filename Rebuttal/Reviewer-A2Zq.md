**Q2&Q4-Brief: Future directions and related work.**

**A:** We appreciate the reviewer's suggestions. In response to your advice, we have made adjustments to our future research directions and related work. Specifically:

- **Future directions.** In the future, we aim to delve deeper into leveraging alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks, opening up new avenues for mitigating popularity bias. Additionally, our proposed hypothesis of aligning and grouping items based on user-specific preferences presents a novel alignment perspective. Moving forward, we envision exploring the synergies between alignment and contrast, as well as extending our approach to mitigate other biases within recommendation systems.
- **Related works.** Thank you for your feedback and made significant improvements to the related work section, aiming for a more comprehensive discussion on debiasing strategies. Specifically, we have expanded the scope of discussion to include recent advancements, categorizing these methods into three groups: Re-weighting, Decorrelation, and Contrastive learning-based approaches, which encompass the techniques you mentioned, such as APDA[1] and AutoDebias[2]. This classification and discussion provide a more thorough background for our model, aiding readers in better understanding our work. Thank you for your suggestions.

If our paper is lucky enough to be accepted, we commit to expanding it into our final manuscript version.
